Dynamic web development group project. The name of our group, LEJT (Swenglish ~ sen, read late) comes from the initials of our first names.
The goal was to deliver a blog site build for a fictional company called Millhouse. The blog is build using object oriented PHP, data base handling (MySQL and PDO) and CSS compiler SASS.

The project has been completed according to the principles of agile methodologies, with each of us taking on the role of SCRUM master each week. We had 4 weeks to complete the project. At the beginning we had to deliver a sales pitch, each week a demo of completed work and at the end a presentation of the final product. We worked extensively with GitHub and command line. The project was completed almost one week ahead of the schedule which allowed us for some final tweaks and testing.

My main areas of responsibility were creating the new blog post, including WYCIWYG (text input form), blog post edit page, about page and contact. I also worked a lot on error handling.
